# VAE-based Tumor Segmentation
This repository contains the files and notebooks, which accompany our (Nicklas Vraa and David Felsager) final project reports. We cannot provide our data, as they take up several Gigabytes of space, but the raw datasets can be found [here](http://medicaldecathlon.com/).

This repository is identical to our [collaboratory repository](https://github.com/felsager/vae_lung_tumor_segmentation)

## Repository Overview
Notebooks:
- To see how we prepared and preprocessed our data, please see the notebook: \
  [1_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/felsager/vae_lung_tumor_segmentation/blob/master/notebooks/1_preprocessing.ipynb)

- To see how we developed our variational autoencoder, please see the notebook: \
  [2_vae_modelling.ipynb](https://github.com/felsager/vae_lung_tumor_segmentation/blob/master/notebooks/2_vae_modelling.ipynb)

- To see how we developed our segmentation decoder, please see the notebook: \
  [3_seg_decoder.ipynb](https://github.com/felsager/vae_lung_tumor_segmentation/blob/master/notebooks/3_seg_decoder.ipynb)

- The model architectures are defined in a separate python file for convenience: \
  [models.py](https://github.com/felsager/vae_lung_tumor_segmentation/blob/master/notebooks/models.py)

- Additional utility functions and constants are also defined in a separate file: \
  [utility.py](https://github.com/felsager/vae_lung_tumor_segmentation/blob/master/notebooks/utility.py)

Thank you for your attention.
